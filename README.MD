# Dynamic Time Warping

This repository was made to store all the logic and implementation of the famous algorithm **Dynamic Time Warping** in Typescript.

This project was made during the “Introduction to Programing” class at Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG). The main goal of the project was to learn and develop one of a list of famous and important algorithms for Computer Science. My algorithm was Dynamic Time Warping which aims to compare two time series trying to minimize negative effects of time by creating a nonlinear alignment between those time series.

One other reason to make this project was to learn Typescript and its specificities.
